# To-Do-List-Website
A dynamic to-do list app built with JavaScript that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Features include task prioritization, persistence using local storage, and interactive UI elements. This project helped me improve my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and data storage in web applications.
